# Web-Crawling-and-Text-Analysis
A basic web crawling program that goes through every url listed in a csv file and extracts textual data from it, without any headers, footers or any extra information. It then performs basic pre-processing and textual analysis, where it calculates the positive score, negative score, word complexity percentage, word count, sentence count, etc.
